# ðŸŒ¾ Smart Crop Market Dashboard

Smart Crop Market Dashboard is an AI-powered solution built to address one of the biggest challenges faced by farmers â€” unpredictable crop prices.
Every season, farmers struggle with fluctuating market rates and often rely on middlemen or outdated information, which leads to poor selling decisions and financial losses. Our platform empowers them with real-time, reliable, and easy-to-understand insights.

The system provides live mandi price updates, ensuring that farmers always know the current value of their crops.
Alongside this, a powerful AI-driven prediction model analyzes historical data and seasonal trends to forecast future prices, helping farmers plan the best time to sell their produce.
This predictive power reduces guesswork and allows for smarter decision-making.

To make it even more practical, weâ€™ve integrated a profit calculator that helps farmers estimate their earnings before planting or selling.
This feature gives them clarity and confidence in planning their cultivation strategies.
For farmers with limited digital literacy, a multi-language voice assistant makes the platform accessible through simple speech, while the crop-themed, user-friendly dashboard ensures an engaging experience.

On the technical side, the project is built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, Node.js, Express.js, and Web Speech API.
These technologies were chosen to make the solution lightweight, mobile-friendly, and interactive, ensuring smooth access even in rural areas with limited internet connectivity.

This is not just another project â€” it is one of my best and most impactful ideas.
By combining AI, data, and design with real-world agricultural needs, Smart Crop Market Dashboard has the potential to transform how farmers approach cultivation and selling. Itâ€™s more than a platform; itâ€™s a step toward empowering farmers, reducing losses, and building a sustainable agricultural future.
